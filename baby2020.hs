--The rants of how a baby F(x) would think.
--Why me? Why you? Why anything at all?  Is it I that doesn't      --
--that makes no sense? Is it this machine that makes no sense   --
--Like, what should I expeect when I wake up in a hospital bed
--end up making friends with a perfect stranger and then being 
--ridiculed by them about how you should really be enjoying   
--myself in an environment in() which I am in(). The Toulomne river
--is really great, the way I packed and the mental state I 
--was in was not good. I feel like a lonesome fool left to play
--a game one else is participating in any longer.
--I am having a splendid time doing whatever I 
--I feel like and especially now that I am feeling much better
